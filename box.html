    /* 
        The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design and layout. It describes how every HTML element is represented as a rectangular box, consisting of four distinct parts (from the inside out):

        Content:
        The innermost part where the text, images, or other content is displayed.

        Padding:
        The space between the content and the border. Padding creates inner spacing inside the box.

        Border:
        The edge around the padding. Borders can have styles, widths, and colors.

        Margin:
        The outermost layer, providing space between the element and neighboring elements. 
    */
    .box {
      width: 200px; /* Width of content */
      height: 100px; /* Height of content */
      padding: 10px; /* Inner spacing */
      border: 5px solid blue; /* Border width, style, color */
      margin: 15px; /* Outer spacing */
      background-color: lightgrey; /* Background for visibility */
    }

    /* 
        The box-sizing property controls how the total width and height of an element are calculated. It determines whether padding and borders are included in the width/height or are added outside.

        By default, browsers use the content-box value for the box-sizing property. This means:
        The width and height you set apply only to the content area.
        Padding and borders are added outside the specified dimensions, making the actual size of the element larger.

        box-sizing: border-box
        When you use box-sizing: border-box:
        The width and height include content, padding, and borders.
        Padding and borders no longer increase the element's size.
